The tour operator invoice you receive will detail the operator's ATOL number. When you buy an air package or flight packaged by Affinion International Travel Limited our ATOL number is 9935. For more information visit the ATOL website at www.atol.org.uk.\n\nIf you book a package holiday that does not include a flight, most tour operators provide financial protection via The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA). For more information visit the ABTA website at www.abta.com. If you book arrangements other than a package holiday or flight, for example accommodation or car hire, ATOL protection does not apply."
