Provided your arranged overdraft balance remains below the interest-free buffer you will not be charged arranged overdraft interest. If your arranged overdraft balance exceeds the interest-free buffer you will be charged arranged overdraft interest on the full arranged overdraft balance. Lending criteria, terms and conditions apply. Lending is subject to credit review and approval. Credit facilities are available to over 18s only who are residents of the Republic of Ireland. You must repay the overdraft on demand.\n\nYour debit balance should not exceed your arranged overdraft limit. If your account overruns without formally agreeing an arranged overdraft, or you exceed your arranged overdraft limit, this is called an Unarranged borrowing. When this happens, you will incur Unarranged borrowing interest as well as the Maintenance Charge.
