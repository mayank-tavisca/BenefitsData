If your account overruns without formally agreeing an overdraft, or you exceed your arranged overdraft limit, this is called unarranged borrowing. When this happens, you will incur Unarranged Borrowing charges as shown in our [A Guide to Personal Account Fees and Interest brochure](http://digital.ulsterbank.ie/content/dam/Ulster/documents/RI%20Region/ri-personal-ulst-brochures/a-guide-to-personal-accounts-fees-and-interest-ULST1376RI.pdf). You will also incur Unarranged Borrowing Interest, which consists of the arranged overdraft interest rate for your account type plus an additional 9% (variable) surcharge rate.\n\nLending criteria, terms and conditions apply. Credit facilities are available to over 18s only. An overdraft is repayable on demand. For more information, please refer to our booklet [A Guide to Personal Account Fees and Interest](http://digital.ulsterbank.ie/content/dam/Ulster/documents/RI%20Region/ri-personal-ulst-brochures/a-guide-to-personal-accounts-fees-and-interest-ULST1376RI.pdf) for more details."
