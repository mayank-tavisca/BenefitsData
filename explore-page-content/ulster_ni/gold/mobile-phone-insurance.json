With your ufirstgold Mobile Phone Insurance, your phone is covered for accidental damage, theft, loss and breakdown (once your manufacturer's warranty has expired). Cover applies worldwide.\n\nWe’ll settle claims with a replacement phone. Our replacement phones are refurbished using genuine manufacturer parts and will be in an “as new” condition. You’re automatically covered but if your phone is registered, it‘ll make it quicker and easier if you need to make a claim. Please remember your mobile phone insurance covers your phone only – that’s the phone you use on a daily basis. It does not extend to phones used on a daily basis by family members or friends even if you pay the bill.\n\nIf your account is in joint names, cover is also provided for the phone the other account holder uses on a daily basis.\n\nThere is no cover for phones owned by your employer.\n\nMobile phone insurance is underwritten by American International Group UK Limited (AIG) and provided by Brightstar Insurance Services, B.V.
